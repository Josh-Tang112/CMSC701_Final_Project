\abstract{We devise and describe a tool for creating an index over a \gzip FASTQ
file. Unlike standard index-creation tools, our tool and the indices that it
creates incorporate a user-specified number of sequence reads that should be
split into each index. This allows a different tool that reads a FASTQ \gzip
file with our pre-built index over it to efficiently process the sequence reads
\emph{in parallel}, rather than needing to process the entire file serially.
This can result in a dramatic speedup for some applications, as we demonstrate
with the simple use case of reading the entire FASTQ file into memory and
writing the decompressed result back to a file.}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Related Work}

Kerbiriou and Chikhi examined parallel decompression of FASTQ \gzip files to
speed up genomic algorithms that require FASTQ
input~\cite{kerbiriou2019parallel}. They do not build an index over the FASTQ
file by making a pass over it as we attempt to do, but rather attempt to
reconstruct data from back-references discovered by reading forward from a
random entry point.

\texttt{zlib}~\cite{zlib} is a C library written by Mark Adler and others that
is able to create and read \gzip files. This library will be important for our
project as it exposes the underlying mechanics for inflating \gzip files.

\texttt{pyfastx}~\cite{pyfastx} is a Python C extension that enables random
reads from FASTA and FASTQ. The functionality that it exposes is similar to our
overall goal and will be a useful source of information and point of comparison.

\texttt{indexed\_gzip}~\cite{indexedgzip} is a project by Paul McCarthy to
create an index over compressed NIFTI image files, which use \gzip compression by
default. This will be another useful point of comparison in a tool that needs to
accomplish a similar task as us.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Sources}

We used four reference FASTQ sequence reads from the Sequence Read
Archive~\cite{SRA} for our testing and analysis. Table~\ref{tab:source} is a
tabular depiction of the data sets that we used for this project. We chose these
files because they represented a wide range of numbers of sequence reads, which
translates into a wide range of \gzip file sizes for our tool to contend with.
Indeed, the largest FASTQ \gzip file we consider is approximately 25 times as
large as the shortest.

\subsection{Index Creation Tool \& Methodology}

We implemented our solution in C in order to take advantage of the library
\zlib~\cite{zlib}. \zlib is a C library written and maintained by Jean-loup
Gailly and Mark Adler since 1995. 

\subsection{Parallel Reading}

    \caption{Time to read differently-sized FASTQ \gzip files using a pre-built
    index file and different numbers of threads. Time compasses total program
    execution, including reading the index files, parallel reading the \gzip
    file with $N$ threads, and writing the reconstituted file to disk. Time for
    \texttt{zcat} to read the file and write it to disk is shown for comparison
    using a dotted line (\texttt{zcat} execution is single threaded). See
    Table~\ref{tab:source} for descriptions of small, medium, large, and XL.}
