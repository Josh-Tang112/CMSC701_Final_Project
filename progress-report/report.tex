\section{Related work}

Kerbiriou and Chikhi examined parallel decompression of FASTQ gzip files to
speed up genomic algorithms that require FASTQ
input~\cite{kerbiriou2019parallel}. They do not build an index over the FASTQ
file by making a pass over it as we attempt to do, but rather attempt to
reconstruct data from back-references discovered by reading forward from a
random entry point.

\section{Plan of Work}

\begin{itemize}

\item Determine what library to use. Initial research suggests this is zlib,
    since that's what gzip uses.
\item Determine when index entries can be made. This may require some trial and
    error creating index entries at different places, but we're not sure whether
        we can create an index entry at an arbitrary bit position, or whether it
        needs to be aligned to some boundary. 
\item Determine what information needs to be stored. This is mostly a function
    of looking at the zlib compression and decompression code, and examining the
    internal state of any exposed data structures to understand what's
        necessary. 
\item Determine what format to store the index data in. If they end up being
    large, may want to look at compressing the data or encoding it somehow.   
\item Create a library that exposes the ``read starting at sequence number
        X given an index file'' logic. This will be complete when we have a
        library we can include in another file with minimal exposed functions
        required to do parallel reads with e.g. pthreads.
\item Compare the time to read various sizes of gzipped FASTQ files using a
    number of threads with the index file and our library vs a sequential
        reader. This will be complete when we've timed the different reads and
        compared them at various file sizes and thread counts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Can index entries be made at any  byte indices, or must they be created at
    a specific point in the gzip file (e.g., at a block boundary?)
\item what is the data structure in zlib that controls
    compression/decompression, and what struct members/other state is required
        in order to reinitialize that structure?
\item Research suggests the zlib state requires a circular buffer of 32KB; how
    to best minimize index size?
\end{enumerate}
